		<h3>Welcome To The Webpage For Megan Ealem's Experiences and Portfolio!</h3>
		<article class="browser">
			<h4>About Me:</h4>
			<p>I am Megan Ealem I am 25 years old student at Eastern Michigan University; as of 2023 I am within the Simulation, 
			Animation, Gaming major with a pyschology minor. I would like to hopefully work with a company who make games 
			as a environmental artist, mechanical rigger, texturer, or modeling. I know a few coding languages as well as 
			an understanding of quite a few adobe products that I can use to do web design or graphic design while looking
			for work or as a side job.</p>

			<h4>What I Have Been Doing:</h4>
			<p>While here I've been working to improve my skills and learn what I really want to do 
			once I leave and to build an impressive portfolio. Most recently I worked with a group to make
			a video game within Unity and we had a showcase at University of Michigan with students from there 
			and Eastern. That was a fun experience making a game with others and then getting to show people
			and play others games.</p>

			<h4>What I Want To Do:</h4>
			<p>Start with an internship with a gaming company either remote or within Michigan hopefully summer of 2024
			to learn how the gaming world operates in the real world rather than just school setting. I will likely
			graduate within the year 2024 or early 2025 then look for a company to work with within the gaming industry.
			I would like to make games as my own company at some point in my life or at the very least on my own on the side;
			these games I would like to focus on awareness for mental health or pyschological disorders.
